# AutoLofi
Linux script that starts Lofi Girl stream on MPV similar to the ones seen on https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/.
The program uses mpv's video playing function so MPV is needed to run this https://mpv.io/installation/ (Check your GUI packege manager for it before using the website)


## Installation

### From Website (here)

- Cick on the Autolofi.sh and select it all and copy 
- Paste into your prefered test editor(nano is mine but anything works)
- Save file as anything you want but add .sh. This will make it easier for you to know what it is but Linux does not care.
- Rpen [Terminal](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal) and CD to the file where you placed the script. 
- Run `sudo chmod +x `.  This will make the script become excutable
- Next part will change Depending on Distro.

### Using git command(terminal)
